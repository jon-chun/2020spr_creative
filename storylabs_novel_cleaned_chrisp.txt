Chapter 1: 2090s Kids      I think you have to genuinely believe you can die for a near death experience to really change you. I was 16 when my first one happened and frankly I didn't give a shit, Dakota said with a smirk meant to impress the woman whose name he'd already forgotten. They sat almost facing each other at the nearly empty bar, nursing somewhere between cocktail number four and six.       What happened to you? the woman asked with exaggerated concern as she played with her long blonde hair.       Long story short I drowned and was in a coma for a bit, Dakota responded.       Oh my god my poor baby. Do you remember any of what happened?      Just bits and pieces, Dakota answered.       It's okay if you don't want to talk about it. I didn't come here for a somber time anyways. Do you want to go back to my place for a nightcap? the woman asked eyeing Dakota's empty drink and finishing the last sip of hers.       Of course, Dakota answered as he extended his right palm to touch the display on the bartender.      Thank you for your patronage of Rasputin's Pub. Please come again, the bartender said in an offensively simulated eastern European accent. Dakota quickly put on his windbreaker as the woman he was with struggled with her thick mink coat. They got up and left in a hurry entering the unusually dry streets of New Orlando.       Would you like a cigarette? the woman asked Dakota and uncharacteristically he responded yes knowing it didn't matter here.       Do you want to buttfuck? the woman asked Dakota after lighting her cig and handing him his.       Dakota burst out laughing before responding; I haven't heard anyone say that in a while. He then proceeded to lean in and touch the butt of his cig to hers. After successfully lighting up in the unusually windless street Dakota proceeded to finally ask, So not to sound like an asshole but could you remind me of your name?       It's totally okay. If your name weren't unique I'd have forgotten it. My username is sofreeya666 but you can call me Sophia, she responded.      So Sophia is your name? Dakota asked.      Maybe, she responded coyly, I don't see why it matters what my name is.      Dakota couldn't see why it mattered either and took another drag off his cig before asking, So which way are we headed?       Fuck. I guess I'm a little drunker than I thought. For a sec I thought I was following you to your place, she explained through her giggles, which quickly gave way to hiccups. You ever think about how we have artificially intelligent drugs that can cure cancer but we still have to deal with hiccups, shitting, farting, pissing, just the general excrement of waste?      No, Dakota answered and the two of them began laughing so hard they had to stop walking and stop smoking for a second.      I just don't understand why the ruling class hasn't fixed this problem with our anatomy for us when they can fix so much stuff that seems a lot more complicated. Do you think maybe it's a massive conspiracy and the rich got that way by monopolizing the sewage and plumbing industry? Sophia asked.      Dakota stroked his chin feigning thought, I mean all the plumbers I've had I've hired have been through Congo Prime and since the flood it seems like we've always got a plumber coming by the house.      Sophia laughed before asking, So should we spend all night trying to uncover this vast conspiracy or just head back to my place?      I think I'd rather spend my night at your place than in the sewers but you tell me, Dakota answered. Sophia grabbed his hand and began pulling him more quickly through sparsely populated streets under an unusually starry sky.       Sophia noticed Dakota's upwards glances before asking, You ever been up there? as she gestured to the stars.       Dakota laughed out loud before responding, I could never afford that shit. I doubt I'll ever be able to afford to leave New Orlando.      Sophia gave Dakota a sympathetic look before continuing to pull him forward. Well there's plenty to see and do down here, she responded as she winked. Dakota flicked his nearly finished cigarette away noticing that Sophia had finished hers. He made eye contact with her for a moment before leaning in hoping she'd do the same. Dakota felt her hand behind his head pulling him in closer. The two held each other in the moonlit street under the shade of skyscrapers and for a moment were lost amongst the stars before. Their moment of bliss was followed by a moment of confusion as Dakota recoiled after hearing loud bangs in the background. What's wrong? Sophia asked.      Fuck I have to go.      Right now? she asked.      Yeah. I'm sorry. I'll explain later?      We'll see, Sophia answered.       Dakota felt a strong upward pull against his center of gravity as if he were freefalling and his vision began to fade to black. His eyes opened and he found himself lying in his messy twin bed. His crotch felt warm and as he patted his pants he realized that it also felt sticky. The loud bangs had not stopped.      Can I have a fucking minute? Dakota shouted.       You've been in there all day and Benny just got back from school. It's his room too! Dakota's father yelled back.       Dakota looked at the perfectly made bed next to his and rolled his eyes before standing up too quickly and collapsing. He slowly crawled over to his dresser and changed on the ground before managing to stand again. As he stood Dakota grabbed his mess and quickly pushed it to the bottom of his laundry pile as the knocking restarted. Moments later Dakota opened the door greeting his brother by shouting; There are you fucking happy?      I don't know why you're coming at me. You just graduated a couple years ago. Don't you remember how shit your days were? Benny asked.      Sorry. You know how I get when I leave the NET.      You can't log off like half an hour before I'm home so I don't have to be greeted like this so often? Benny retorted with a harsh tone but his typical concerned expression. I will try and work on it, Dakota responded vacantly.He could sense their conversation was not done but moved to sit on his bed and faced forward avoiding Benny's sympathetic gaze. Dakota could feel Benny's eyes on him and could easily imagine what he was thinking.  What condescending bullshit question do you have for me today? Dakota asked.Benny looked at his brother and did not recognize the look in his dark eyes. He never could for a while after Dakota would unplug. Benny hated coming home and seeing Dakota like this more days than not but was smart enough to know when and how to pick his fights.Do you mind if I try and get some shit done for school? Benny asked.Yeah sure, Dakota responded before lying back in his bed and allowing himself to fall away back into the NET. Chapter 2: A Brave New World?Dakota returned to activities in his mind that Benny couldn't hope to comprehend. All Benny could do was watch him lie motionless. He didn't look asleep. He looked dead. This sight was always a distraction to Benny and he decided to work outside. He left their apartment uninterrupted like usual and made his way down their dingy hallway past the faint smell of mildew. The concrete staircase gave him a brief respite from the dank carpeted halls before he made his way to the soaking alley behind their building. As he opened the door water droplets pelted his face from the harsh winds. Benny thought about pushing forward but decided to retreat and change his boots. As he made his way up the first flight of stairs dreading the next twenty-eight until he began to hear a familiar wailing.       Please enter the nearest emergency shelter for your safety, the loudspeaker echoed ad nauseum to the citizens of New Orlando. Please ensure your own safety before ensuring the safety of others. Pets and personal artifacts will not be permitted within any public emergency shelter without the proper documentation. You must provide proof of citizenship upon arrival at any public emergency shelter for admittance. The message blared loudly before its repetition in Spanish followed by a further repetition in English continuing a seemingly endless cacophony.       Benny waited at the bottom of the stairs his feet drenched dreading the journey they would have to make. He waited tapping his fingers nervously against his thigh waiting for Dakota and his father to rush down the stairs. He stood in the corner by the door and tried to ignore the people splashing by soaking his pants as they rushed through the increasingly wet hallway. It got to the point in the evacuation where even old people struggling with mobility were making their way into the alley. In the hall the water had risen up to Benny's ankles and he resolved to trudge back up the twenty-eight flights of stairs. As he made his way up the stairs he wondered how Dakota had fucked things up this time. Benny opened the door and was greeted with a yell,      Who the fuck is there! I have an assault rifle and I'll blow your fucking head off! Dakota shouted.      Benny walked in confused, It's me and I know we don't own a gun.      You scared the shit out of me. I figured you were a looter trying to make a big score. The most valuable shit in this place is probably our fucking copper piping though, Dakota commented as he ran his fingers nervously through his hair.       Why the fuck aren't you guys evacuating? This isn't time for your dicking around! Benny shouted looking around for his father.      Dad is on the couch. I think he had a stroke. He's having trouble talking and walking, Dakota stated blankly as he continued pacing and running his fingers through his hair.       Dad can you hear me? Benny asked slowly.      His dad nodded in response but could barely utter a response.      What do we do? Dakota asked fear flashing in his eyes.      Like always Benny took charge, The nearest shelter is only a couple blocks away. If we can get one of his arms over each of our shoulders we can hoist him there.      The brothers hoisted their father off the couch wrapping his arms around their shoulders as they began trudging down the stairs. When they reached the bottom the water was up to their thighs and like always Benny had an idea, We could lay dad on his back and push him through the streets. The water is high enough right now.      Dakota nodded in agreement and they began pushing their dad through what were in that moment canals. The streets lit up red and blue as the sirens continued to urge citizens towards shelters. They avoided floating purses and other remnants of the panicked rush they'd missed. Police officers patrolled the streets scooping up valuables. Dakota contemplated doing the same while Benny ignored their routine and continued their journey. The sounds of sirens and warnings to take shelter grew louder as they neared their destination.       The shelter they were pushing towards had been constructed from a converted high school. Its blocky rooms had been modified with steel plates replacing the thin windows. Little else had to be done to seal the building off from the outside and former students like Benny and Dakota's dad joked about how the place was more like a prison back when it was still a school. This time their father was unresponsive as they pushed him to the entrance of the shelter. As they approached the National Guard soldiers by the sliding steel door raised their rifles and began moving forwards. Dakota and Benny waited for them to approach knowing that their late entrance would lead to an unwarranted hassle.       Freeze and put your hands in the fucking air! the commanding officer shouted.      Our dad is unresponsive if we let go of him he will obviously sink, Benny sarcastically responded.      You treat me with the respect I've earned! the soldier shouted as he began shining the flashlight mounted below his rifle into Benny's eyes.       The downpour had not slowed at all and rain continued to pelt their father's face. Can you please just let us the fuck in before you make our dad drown? Dakota yelled.       Do not swear at me again or I will interpret it as a threat, the soldier yelled while his men continued to shine their flashlights into the brothers' eyes.       Please just scan us, verify our identity and let us in. I'm sorry about him. We pose no threat, Benny pleaded.       It's not your job to decide whether or not you pose a threat, the soldier responded while signaling to his men. They made a show of meandering over towards Dakota and Benny's father to scan him before slowly scanning the brothers.      You're free to enter now, the soldier stated emphasizing the now that he had gotten to decide.      Can you help us carry our father? Benny asked politely as the steel door opened and the water lowered forcing him to quickly begin hoisting his father in tandem with Dakota.       I'm sorry but I can't spare any of my men, the soldier responded.       You're not fucking sorry, Dakota muttered.      What did you just say to me young man? Nothing, Benny responded.I wasn't talking to you smartass. What did you just say to me? the soldier repeated while looking at Dakota.Nothing, Dakota muttered.Wrong fucking answer. I told you if you swore at me again I'd interpret it as a threat, the soldier stated before smashing Dakota's ribcage with the butt of his rifle. Dakota lost his balance, then Benny and finally their father. The commanding officer watched gleefully as his men stared at the scene expressionless. Dakota and Benny struggled to get up and carry their bleeding father into the shelter while the commanding officer watched with a glare that made it clear he wished he could lock them outside during the storm. As they entered the large cubic room, formerly a gym their father would normally comment, some emergency service volunteers rushed to help the family. They bandaged Dakota's ribs and patched up the cuts the asphalt had left on Benny and their father. Their dad remained motionless but breathing on a stretcher in the makeshift triage that emerged each time the shelter was used. The EMS workers placed a respirator over their dad's mouth and an EEReader over his head. What do you think is wrong? Benny asked the volunteers. The EEReader is saying that your father is unconscious due to a brain hemorrhage as well as hypoxia, one of the volunteers replied nervously, We should be able to keep him stable here until the storm passes but we're going to have to put him on full life support as soon as possible after. Fuck, Dakota muttered holding back tears.Benny glared at him before turning to the volunteers and asking, Is there any hope of recovery? If you're able to get him NET then yes, the volunteer responded before scanning their father with his tablet. Unfortunately it appears you do not qualify for NET installation under your state issued medical coverage. How much would it cost to have installed privately? Benny asked. Around 250K give or take, the volunteer responded with a distant look in her eyes. Guessing it's even more in Torings? Dakota asked.Benny glared at him as the volunteer nodded. They didn't have the clean cash for NET and Benny doubted Dakota had the drive or intelligence to make enough dirty money anyways. Dakota's impulsivity had always annoyed Benny but never more than now.Is it okay if we speak privately for a moment? Benny asked the volunteer. Of course, she responded before leaving them alone in the corner where their father's stretcher was located.You really had to go and run your fucking mouth? Benny asked his brother as he sat on the ground holding his head in his hands.You think this is my fault? Dakota retorted angrily.I didn't say that did I? Benny responded slowly.Do you always have to be so condescending when we fight? Dakota asked angrily.Apparently I do because you're smart enough to know that people in power will show you their power if you question it, Benny retorted, And what was with that stupid fucking question anyways? We have no Torings and it's not exactly like you've got the brains to become a crime lord. I've heard some rumors in the NET about ways to get around the restrictions they built. If we can hack our minds we can hack the tool we used to hack our minds, Dakota responded excitedly.Well if you've heard about these rumors why haven't you followed up on them? Benny asked.I've heard about some side effects. It's hard to tell what's real or not, Dakota answered tentatively. Well I don't have NET so there's no way I'm going to find out, Benny replied. Besides how do you see this making us any money? I figure if I can get hack a NET I can bypass restrictions and give myself the knowledge to make the money to help out dad.That sounds way too good to be true, Benny stated.I mean real money can be used in NET and earned in NET and exchanged outside of it. After all that was its original purpose, Dakota responded with a smirk.Whatever. Give it a shot. I'll keep studying and try and get an actual that pays actual money so maybe we can NET installed before they take dad off life support, Benny retorted angrily. Well it's a little late for me to take that route, Dakota responded and Benny sadly had to agree. Chapter 3: Knowledge is Power?Benny was locked into the screen of his laptop typing furiously at his desk. Dakota lay in his messy bed oblivious to the incessant clicking next to him. It had been a day since their father had been brought to an ICU and put on life support. The doctors had stabilized the hemorrhaging in his brain as well as his oxygen levels but recovery was impossible without neural reconstruction through NET and Benny knew from filing their family's taxes each year that the most they could hobble together wouldn't even cover a down payment on a NET and knew that the Neural Engineering Tool was impossible for them to afford again. This accidentally led Benny down one of the self-pity rabbit holes he typically worked to avoid. He thought NET was wasted on Dakota. Dakota got access to the most powerful piece of technology available to the public and used it to dick around in cyberspace. Benny thought about how he would use his time in that space to learn even more about programming and the technology he'd be experiencing. Instead Benny was relegated to created virtual instances on his computer he could only witness and live vicariously through using a controller his father had used for similar programs designed by other humans during his childhood. Now the virtual experiences off NET were algorithmic designed by machine learning programs meant to placate the human reward system enough for those to poor for NET to be satisfied with the level of pleasure technology could afford them. Benny stared across the room at Dakota's smiling face wondering what convincing bliss he got to experience. In the meantime Benny continued working on a virtual reality he'd been programming to practice and then maybe submit as an application for a job he figured he'd never get. Benny missed his dad's words of encouragement and the awe he'd express each time he tried out one of Benny's projects. You would've been the biggest game designer back in my day, he'd say, I can't believe you can make this by yourself. It used to take hundreds of people to something a tenth this size! Benny missed his father's optimism although even that its limits in uplifting him. Benny knew he could only do what he did because he had the help of artificial intelligence programs. Sure it saved him time doing mundane work like placing pebbles in an alleyways but it also meant at least in his mind that he wouldn't have been as successful during his dad's childhood as his dad liked to think. After working all night again Benny's project was complete. It was a demo of what he hoped to develop into a virtual reality, at the moment it was more of a virtual instance revealing the possibilities for the universe he hoped to get paid to complete. It had everything that people seem to love in entertainment and captured the freedom and excitement only a life of crime could provide. Benny was still against his brother's criminal aspirations but figured that NET hacking was really too good to be true and that Dakota would distract him from their real shot out of New Orlando less if he was passed out. After running through his virtual instance a few times Benny submitted it to every virtual reality production company he could think of and hoped one of their algorithms would deem his work worthy of a follow up. These algorithms ran nearly instantly but not faster than Benny's eyelids and he fell asleep at his computer again falling facedown on his bent arm dreaming about the past he wished he could reprogram.  Chapter 4: Electric FeelsDakota sunk into himself in the discomfort of his poorly made bed in their especially lifeless flat. Benny was off somewhere else working on something Dakota figured as his eyes adjusted to the sun shining over New Orlando. He felt bad his brother would likely never get to see such a clear sky but hoped that his dad would not end up relegated to the same fate. His hope felt more like mourning given the slim odds he'd find the magic sounding technology everyone whispered about in NET.  Dakota stared at the sun knowing it wouldn't hurt his eyes here appreciating a brief respite from the darkness he and everyone else in New Orlando had grown accustomed to. He decided to head downtown and was there in a moment. The gilded marble buildings that comprised the Land of the Lotus Eaters Resort, Casino, and Spa was one of his favorite destinations to frequent and he appeared there with a thought. He appreciated the reflective chandeliers that hung in the cavernous lobbies to each casino. The sunlight made the buildings more majestic in NET than they could ever be in dimly lit reality. Dakota wished he could count cards but knew that wouldn't work here anyways and he'd never been good enough at math or focusing on one task long enough to learn how. He thought back to the family poker games he used to play with Benny and his parents back before the flood. Their mom had always taught them to save and their dad thought teaching them poker was the best way to demonstrate this. He was always the dealer and always ended up with most of Dakota's cash. Dakota learned the house always won unless you spent most of your day studying statistics and obsessing over probabilities like Benny. Benny could always beat the house but never really tried. It would be another few months before he could legally gamble anyways. Dakota wandered around the casino floor distracted by the blaring music, chatter of conversation, and flashing lights. They weren't the type of distracting he wanted so he headed over to Poseidon's Well for a drink or ten.  The dimly lit bar was as good a place as any for Dakota to think about the day that felt a lifetime away. He ordered a drink from the bartender, a Manhattan, his dad's favorite. He'd always dreamed of getting out of New Orlando to New York City. Dakota could never understand his dad's obsession with this particular escape plan and was less discerning about where he got his. He sat alone at the bar deciding that tonight an individual instance made more sense than one of the shared virtual worlds he usually loaded into. Dakota preferred feeling shitty by himself and the NET afforded him privacy their family's tiny apartment never could. Every few minutes Dakota would finish a drink and signal to the bartender for another. He enjoyed drinking in NET better. Getting too drunk or hungover was impossible unless for whatever reason someone wanted to enable the neural connections that make people feel that special type of terrible. Dakota had always been more of a narcissist than a masochist and decided that he was better off inviting someone to his pity party so he sent sofreeya666 a message, I'm not sure I believe you've been off world but I'm down to get high either way. Funny message. Didn't have you pegged for clever after the first time we met, came a voice from behind Dakota. He turned and got cigarette smoke in his eye forcing him to back up into the bar with a thud at the sudden of Sophia.You scared the shit out of me, Dakota responded with a laugh, Do you always show up this quickly when some random guy you met in NET sends you a message?Well I can't be in two places at once and you've seen me… so obviously not, Sophia responded, So are we getting high? How are we getting high?Well okay. Guess we aren't doing small talk. I kind of figured given you'd strongly implied you've been off world you could afford some interesting stuff you may want to try with me, Dakota responded a his face grew red.Oh so you're a gold digger? Sophia responded with a laugh and a long pause before continuing, It's okay I am too. I have been off world and that's how I did it.Sorry if I was a mark. I didn't mean to come off as rich, Dakota responded. You did not come off rich at all, she replied with a laugh, Any reason you chose now to send me a message?I had a shitty day. I've been looking for a way out and alcohol obviously isn't cutting it.Any interest in seeing me? Sophia asked with a wink. Of course. Also partially because I wanted to finish our conversation that was so rudely interrupted.Well you're in luck Dakota. I've got nothing but time and I would love to get you high.I thought you were a gold digger? Dakota responded, I'm flattered you're willing to redistribute some of that wealth to me though.When you're a good enough gold digger you end up with a bottomless gold mine.Do you think you could teach me a trick or two? I can do more than that, Sophia answered, Have you heart of NET hacking?Fuck yeah I have, Dakota exclaimed.I can get you set up, Sophia said with a smirk.What do you want for it? Dakota asked suspiciously. I just want to spend some time here tonight. Maybe get high like we talked about, play a few hands at one of the tables, I don't really care.Fuck yeah, how do I install it? Sophia reached her hand forward in its pale silk glove until it was inside of the rendering of the inside of Dakota's chest. His skin began to flow and Dakota began to feel different as his body came apart and reassembled continuously turning from flesh to fractals and back. Chapter 5: Back to the FutureBenny awoke at his desk expecting a familiar automated message, Your application has been denied. Please improve x variable y percent for better success in the future. We at Congo value your submissions and dedication to the entertainment ecosystem you are a valued part of! This time the variable was player agency and the percentage of affect he had missed by was only 4%. It was the closest he'd come to getting his submission accepted and the first time there was only one variable to fix so he allowed himself a brief celebration. He walked into the kitchen and prepared himself a cup of coffee using half of their remaining beans. Unfortunately increased rainfall caused erosion on most of the plantations that made outdoor farming unsustainable. Benny treasured the brief moments of stimulation he was allowed and used his increased energy to dive back into his work. He brought his coffee over to his laptop and continued to click away this time louder and faster but still not loudly enough to distract Dakota from whatever distraction he was allowing himself. Benny had an hour before he had to go to school and worked on adding in more ways that players can break the rules established in the world he'd created. At this point he'd submitted enough of his work to understand that player agency just means a player's ability to break the rules of the world. He'd never been this close and as the hour concluded Benny struggled to pull himself away from his laptop so he could go to class and learn to perfect his ability to appease a different algorithm the SAT.  Benny packed his laptop and exited Genesis Tools, the program he'd been using. He headed down the same empty stairs that had been clamoring with people days earlier. He thought about what had happened and began to grow angry. By the time he reached the bottom of the stairs he was walking at a jogging pace and slammed the door to the alley that he had waited in front of for too long. A pleasant drizzle and pale overcast clouds met him on his walk from the building's back alley to the street. He walked past dozens of other large concrete apartment complexes as traffic whirred quietly by. The streets were so clean they shined thanks to the rain and cameras that Benny was rarely aware of unlike his brother. Most figured it wasn't worth littering given that the only solution to New Orlando's prison overcrowding was the inevitable flooding. Dakota saw the nondescript concrete building where he had his classes. He approached and recognized one of the security guards at the entrance of his school from his weekend job as a weekend warrior. Benny thought back to the way that this man had so disinterestedly watched his father almost die. Instead of going to school, or rather the room where Benny's classes and exams were administered, he decided to take a page out of his father's book and cut class. Benny remembered his father's stories well and was always fascinated and somewhat envious of them. Benny's dad would always tell him how disinterested with sharing his past his father was. Rather than continue this trend he did the opposite and Benny remembered many of the times his father had cut class. Unlike his father Benny didn't have many friends. He usually spent the socialization periods between classes in his school programming, fifteen minutes wasn't enough time for Benny to have a worthwhile conversation let alone initiate one. Benny remembered his dad would always talk about going to the beach at night to smoke and drink with his friends at bonfires. It was usually too windy and wet to get one started now but Benny figured he could have a drink and a smoke by himself during the day without any fire and it would be more or less the same. Benny figured he'd already cut class so he may as well do something with that time and went to the nearest Toring Machine to convert some of his clean cash into an untraceable cryptocurrency that could be kept on an internal wallet like the implant Benny placed against the machine when he thumbed it. He converted fifty dollars figuring that would be enough to get some alcohol and a joint on FinalBay an app that Benny decided to install onto his tablet for the first time. He ordered a joint and a 24oz beer figuring that would be enough. Benny didn't want to ruin his brain seeing it was his only one. A few minutes later a white car appeared and the passenger seat opened up to reveal a small white box and a 24oz bottle in the cup holder and left Al Caboner a five star review on Final Bay before getting into the car and thumbing the dashboard selecting a beach on the outskirts of New Orlando that he used to visit with his dad. Benny lit the joint in the car and got out only to be met by a gust of wind that forced him back inside the car. Not wanting to risk anything getting picked up by any sensors he exited the car quickly and let the wind slam the door behind him before taking shelter behind a large rock in front of an outcrop of palm trees. The water was a murky brown and Benny was thankful that the rock he'd taken shelter behind was on the edge of the coast so he didn't have to get his feet wet. He struggled to finish the joint burning off excess paper continuously as the winds disrupted the air between each hit. Benny struggled to hold them in as long as he could like his brother told him he should. For a moment Benny felt bad for not inviting Dakota with him forgetting about his anger at what Dakota had let happen to their dad. Benny coughed and puffed his way through the joint as quickly as he could before beginning his first drink. He hated the taste but was thankful for the relief it gave his charred throat. With each sip his father's fall felt further away. Benny could faintly picture what the view would be like if he could see the horizon like he used to as a kid with his family at this same spot. He thought back to how Dakota would always instigate splashing fights and sand wrestling. Benny would play along but was never as competitive and didn't like making Dakota lose. Dakota was a sore loser. Benny thought back to what had happened and wondered if it was really Dakota's fault. He hadn't told Dakota how he really felt about that day fearing his response and was angry he couldn't hold him responsible. Benny took another sip of his beer and thought about calling a car so he could go home and give Dakota a piece of his mind but like always resolved to take the high road and do nothing. Instead he continued to drink in silence as the pleasant drizzle and unpleasant gusts decided to switch. It began to poor, but the wind let up, and Benny decided to be thankful for that and finish his beer in the pouring rain. It tasted like stale carbonated water to him anyways and a little more water surely wouldn't change that. Chapter 6: Just Dropped InDakota felt himself floating in a familiar void. He was back in the place where he didn't know about space, time, or himself. He tried to take in what he could of this space before feeling a violent rush upwards as his mind reconnected to his eyes and he could see a beautiful woman standing in front of him. Her piercing eyes bore into his soul and he hoped she could what he just had. As these thoughts left him Dakota began to violently cough before shouting, What the fuck was that?Your NET got reset during the process. It happens to everyone. You were back at the moment it was first installed, this cornerstone file is our key to hacking NET, Sophia responded.Our key? Dakota asked.My key, I mean Sophia responded, you're one of the few people I've gifted this to. How does it work? Dakota asked.Well you NET is your mind so you just have to will what you want, Sophia responded, You can bypass all the limitations they placed on you here to encourage you not to spend all your time in NET.So basically I'm a god? Dakota asked.I mean like any hack there are limitations to what it can do. You can make services not charge you but you can't give yourself money. Obviously the system would pick that up or any attempted cash outs.Thank you so much for this but fuck. I thought NET hacking was an easy way to get rich, Dakota said. I'm sorry. There are lots of urban legends about hacking, Sophia responded unapologetically. Well fuck it I guess if I can bypass the limitations they place on us here I can slow down time and have fun in here with you for a while right? Dakota asked as he willed a joint into his hand and began to inhale it the way he'd always instructed his brother to. We're in a private instance so yes, Sophia answered, Obviously developers need to be able to slow things down so they have more time to work but they can't slow other people down.Didn't need to throw in the obviously, Dakota responded as he took a drag from his joint and ashed it on the bartender moving so fast Dakota's he would think it was magic if we were at all sentient. Sorry I don't mean to be condescending. I won't have to be. You can read everything ever right now if you wanted in an instant, Sophia said with a smirk and a laugh.I may not seem like an academic but I fucked with philosophy a bit when I was in school, Dakota responded, If I've read every book won't I be a nerd because my memory will be so dominated by things people with too much free time wrote? You have a philosophical objection to getting omniscience? Sophia asked laughing.Be wary of unearned ideas, Dakota responded.I think you meant be wary of unearned wisdom, Sophia retorted, You were trying to quote Carl Jung right?I guess. I mean I just knew some philosophy guy said it. If I could've quoted it right I'm not sure I'd be me, Dakota objected. I guess, Sophia responded, So about getting high. Are we going to do that?Yeah. Dealer's choice, Dakota answered.Have you ever heard of Deems? Sophia asked.DMT?Yeah have you tried it? Sophia asked. It's expensive on Final Bay and I don't have access to anywhere in the world it's legal in NET, Dakota answered. A giant bong that went up to Sophia's chest appeared in front of her with a blend of brown herbs and yellow powder in its comically large bowl.  Do you want to keep talking or are you ready to blast off? she asked. Dakota nodded before Sophia passed him the bong and he filled its massive chamber with cloudy smoke. He caught the overwhelming smell of what he would later recognize as mothballs before Sophia caught him and helped him lie back. You're going past the stars, she whispered as her face turned to fractals and Dakota recognized her as a part of himself and felt connections he knew for a fact had to reach outside of the NET he forgot he was in. The bar of the casino became an oceanic temple from the past and the future with Sophia it's ruling goddess and Dakota was a part of them all and knew that for a few moments that felt like years as he closed his eyes and felt his head melt into his hands before entering an endless upwards tunnel to another world. Dakota knew he was home and couldn't wait to tell the beings made of fractals and lights that greeted where he had been but realized that they already knew. Dakota forgot himself or his father but would from this moment on be more discerning about his form of escape. Alcohol allowed him to escape a moment but now he had escaped himself. He felt a love for the beings around him and as a result himself that was more intense than any love he had felt before. Dakota would feel guilty remembering this thought in the context of his mother and the memories surrounding her, but for once he was free of those memories. He forgot about the earth, language, humanity, the problems those three things created for each other and in collaboration with each other. Then Dakota began to feel himself fall back into his body. Back through the same tunnel he'd ascended moments earlier. The air still squiggled and patterns covered the corners of his vision as he reopened his eyes to see Sophia's smiling face there to greet him. Being a human is weird, Dakota observed laughing. Trust me, I know, Sophia laughed before asking, Where did you go? Tell me all about it?Dakota decided share the most private and significant moment of his life with her and began to feel a connection similar to what he had felt for those beings that felt realer than anything outside of NET ever had. He asked Sophia if he was crazy. She responded with a laugh. Chapter 7: SurfBenny entered their apartment smiling and soaked. He walked past their living room and their dad's closed door with a vacancy he'd never experienced before. He entered his room to find Dakota smiling in bed. He got changed before shaking his brother awake. What the fuck? Dakota answered.You've been in there too long. What's up? Benny asked.Dakota looked at his brother's droopy bloodshot eyes partially covered by his long wet black hair and burst out laughing. You're fucked up.That I am, Benny responded laughing too.Why? Dakota asked.Dad always had the best stories about his childhood. I don't really have any stories, Benny said his eyes beginning to water. Hopefully you're just sad when you're crossed. I don't like to party with sad drunks, Dakota joked. I'm not sad. I'm happy, Benny retorted.That's good. Just cause you're fucked up? Dakota asked.No. I made a story today. Also I was only off 4% in one category with the story I've been programming, Benny slurred.Holy fucking shit! You might get a job out of this! You could get dad a NET we could finally leave this shithole city! Dakota shouted. Yeah.You good? Dakota asked.No, Benny answered before rushing to the bathroom. Dakota got him some water and made him breakfast in the morning surprised at the opportunity to take care of his younger brother. Growing up their dad would always accidentally refer to Benny as Dakota's older brother when introducing them to people. They used to laugh about it but they both began to find it less funny as they grew older. Good morning, Benny mumbled as he walked into their living room kitchen. Dakota responded with a nod and continued working on the eggs and toast he'd been preparing. So what did you do yesterday? Dakota asked.I was thinking about dad and all his stories about the parties they used to have by the beach. I figured why not cut class and do the same thing by myself? Benny answered.So you drank and smoked by yourself on the beach in the rain?Yeah I guess so.I'm sorry but I'm just thinking about you smoking and drinking and brooding by yourself in the rain and it is like some shit of out of a movie, Dakota said with a laugh.       Benny was always good at laughing at himself and was able to acknowledge he may have behaved a little melodramatically, Yeah I guess I probably did look ridiculous.       So how does that programming thing you were talking about work exactly. What do you mean you were off 4%? Dakota asked.       Basically I send my demo of the virtual experience I created to a bunch of algorithms that sort through these experiences and choose the creators of the best ones to come work for them. So I was off by 4% in one category. I need to give the player more agency to make the world more believable so that people will want to pay to experience it.       Well I might be able to play it, Dakota responded with a smirk.      How? Even if I had NET I couldn't play it unless we were a lot richer.      I got a hack for my NET, Dakota exclaimed.      Wow. I'm impressed you waited so long to say I told you so, Benny responded.      Well I was going to last night but I was worried you were too fucked up to remember, Dakota retorted.       I bet you can't get any money out though right? Benny asked smugly.      Yeah I was wrong about that bit, Dakota answered. You'd be able to load the file if I sent it to you so you could play through it? Benny asked.I don't know. Message it to me and I'll load in and check, Dakota answered.They abandoned the mostly eaten breakfast the Dakota had prepared, wasting their food a luxury they couldn't afford yet. Dakota laid down in bed and logged in so fast his legs were half hanging off the bed. Benny was in too much of a rush to hear what his program was really like to bother repositioning them and exported and sent his experience as quickly as he could. Chapter 8: Little Brother      Please enter the nearest emergency shelter for your safety, the loudspeaker echoed ad nauseum to the citizens of New Orlando. Please ensure your own safety before ensuring the safety of others. Pets and personal artifacts will not be permitted within any public emergency shelter without the proper documentation. Please provide proof of citizenship upon arrival at any public emergency shelter for admittance. The message blared loudly before its repetition in Spanish followed by a further repetition in Japanese before finally reaching another English repetition continuing a seemingly endless cacophony.       Pat and Dak sat on the rusty patio of their dingy apartment passing a mirror for makeup they didn't own back and forth taking lines of blow before locking up their stash in the allegedly indestructible safe they'd purchased to make sure karma wouldn't bite them in the ass. They watched the crowd flow like the tsunami they thought they were running from leaving similar destruction in their wake. Like always Dak and Pat observed making brief eye contact for a quick chuckle at the absurdity of everyone else.       Imagine being such a pussy you're still scared of a storm from like twenty fucking years ago, Pat commented.       We'd have to get real jobs and pay taxes to fund this bullshit if it weren't for these pussies so whatever. Shout out to pussies, Dak joked back.      So who are we hitting this time? Pat asked.      I was thinking we hit Dave's place. He's some smalltime loser some of our clients have mentioned to me. I think he just peddles psychedelics and you know how hippies are about guns, Dak explained.       Sounds good. No ties to the Yakuza right? Pat asked.      His name is Dave bro. Common, Dak responded shaking his head.       I don't know man. With racial reassignment surgery these days it's not like you can tell. He could've got that shit done before coming stateside, Pat retorted.      I've never heard of anyone without clean cash getting that shit done but fuck it. Either way we're gonna send it so let's quit fucking around and go rob this bitch.       Obviously Dak brought a little vile for their work knowing they'd have to be at their sharpest. Before leaving the house they put on mesh bandanas and blacked out sunglasses and grabbed the submachine guns they'd had printed a couple years back. After getting ready for their busy day they climbed down the fire escape in the pouring rain making sure to leave it lowered incase the monsoon got high enough to cover the first floor entry way. The same warnings blared over New Orlando's loud speakers as searchlights and sirens coated the city. Pat and Dak stuck to back alleys to avoid the patrols of police officers warning citizens to safety while taking any undamaged valuables they'd dropped running to shelter.       Criminals that hide behind the law are the biggest pussies of us all, Dak whispered to Pat as they approached the apartment complex they'd heard was Dave's.       I heard he's in unit 43B so should we just break into one of these first floor units and climb up? Pat asked staring up at the ledge to a first floor window.       Yeah I'll hoist you up then you grab me, Dak responded before taking a bump from his vile and giving one to Pat. He then hoisted Pat up to the ledge and reached up to follow. Pat smashed the glass quickly and the wind hurled the shattering pieces past him as the two entered a pitch-dark apartment. Moments later a white flash erupted and the two collapsed to the ground unconscious.       Dak and Pat awoke in a completely metallic room with cold hard handcuffs binding them to their cool chrome seats. They both were too incapacitated to look terrified and instead their perfectly sculpted faces looked vacant as they often did. In front of them was a door that clanged open as they began to regain consciousness. A short skinny white man with sandy surfer hair and blue eyes entered wearing Buddhist prayer beads and robes. Large Asian men fully covered in traditional tattoos including their faces flanked him on either side.       Hey guys what's up you probably know me as Dave, not Dave said sort of introducing himself.       Do you know we are? Pat asked painfully aware of his uncovered face.       Oh yeah. I know who everyone is, not Dave responded, I don't know who you are though. Not even you could know that yet.      Are you going to keep saying vague smart sounding shit while waiving your hands around like some kind of prophet or are you going to explain what the fuck is actually going on? Dak asked angrily.      Dave let out a false sounding laugh before continuing; Only villains give exposition about themselves and their plans in fiction. Reality is just fiction come to life. Simple stories subverted by equally predictable variables. Villains are always narcissists. I am not a villain but a hero. I left my ego in Shambhala and have returned to spread the truth.       Bro you sound like every acid kingpin ever. Honestly we were just trying to rob you so we could finally buy our way off this fucking island but clearly we underestimated whoever or whatever you are, Dak retorted.       Dakota Sellers you are strong of spirit. Very few men ever speak to me in such an antagonistic manner when so clearly compromised, not Dave responded before nodding to one of the large men flanking him. The man nodded back before looking at Dak and punching him in the face.       Dak's ears rang and he spat blood on the ground. I'm sure this room was designed to be bleached easy but your clothes weren't, Dak retorted before spitting blood all over Dave's elaborate robes. He took another punch before shouting, If you're going to kill me please just get it over with. I've always wondered what comes next.      Patrick Charles what are your thoughts about this moment? Dave asked eerily sincerely.       I don't know, Pat mumbled before breaking down sobbing.      You are afraid, Dave whispered leaning over towards Pat's ear, I can feel your heart rate rising. I could feel it rise as you shattered my glass window and as Dak goaded you to climb up here. After finishing with his assessment Dave nodded towards one of his guards.      Dak heard a blast and then ringing. He struggled to reorient himself with reality before glancing to his left and seeing the hole where Pat's perfected face had been only moments earlier. Dak continued sitting in silence watching Dave and his guards lack any emotion or reaction to the murder that had just occurred.       I see potential in you Dakota, Dave continued with his soliloquy, You don't show your fear like Pat. You got him to follow you through control of his fear and your own. You are a leader whether you know it or not Dakota. I need leaders. I have plenty of followers amongst me and at this point they offer me nothing. They sow no more of their own. It takes leadership to amass a following and you are lucky for I have selected you.        Why the fuck would I ever do anything for you? Dak shouted.       Let me show you, not Dave responded before nodding to each of his guards. They then promptly approached Dak opening his mouth as Dave produced a bioluminescent flower from one of his pockets. Dak's muffled screams echoed throughout the metallic room as Dave's guards slid a mouth prop into his open lips to keep them in place.      One leaf from this lotus will show you your path, not Dave continued before gingerly dropping it on Dak's tongue.      Dak felt the leaf dissolve as the room faded to black and the idea of Dak left him.              Chapter 9: Dak or Dakota?Dakota felt himself rushing upwards and began remembering himself. Nobody had called him Dak since high school and the memories that flitted by instantaneously relative to Benny were intricate, methodical, and slow to Dakota.Dak watched slides portraying America's violent history flicker by as his teacher continued to talk at him. History didn't interest him much and neither did his teacher despite being programmed specifically for engaging students. Like always he sat and stared into space wondering why he had to learn here. The socialization periods allocated between classes weren't mandatory and most students preferred to beat the program as quickly as they could and go home. Dak knew they could do it from home.  Dakota, Mr. Horton began as Dak's eyes widened, I was wondering if you could tell me some parallels between the Great Depression and the present from last night's reading that we haven't discussed yet. Dak hadn't read but had begun progressing from being an intermediate bullshitter to an expert and quickly came up with a convincing answer, Americans tend to sacrifice their personal liberties during times of crisis.Actually, I believe that the author stated that Americans gain a sense of unified purpose during times of crisis, Mr. Horton corrected.Sorry, I gave my own interpretation of his point because the author failed to mention the race baiting of the Great Depression, Dak retorted in an effort to appear to have read.  Ah, you already beat me to the next question. What are some other things that the author failed to account for when coming to this conclusion? Mr. Horton asked the class.Dak wondered if his teacher made him feel like his answer was good to try and trick him into learning or if he had actually learned something and recited it properly despite his best efforts. He also wondered why his teacher was a man. He figured that if the artificial intelligence program really knew how to trick him into learning it would appear as an attractive woman rather than some old guy. Maybe it knew that wouldn't trick Dak because he'd know she wasn't real. Either way he didn't care and continued giving made up answers to made up questions hoping he could beat the algorithm and get home as quickly as possible. Suddenly Dakota had returned to himself Dak a distant memory before he found himself elsewhere in his memories. Dak! he turned hearing his mother's yell over the commotion surrounding their booth in the 50s style diner. Everyone was shouting to each other as the glass panes surrounding the restaurant began to slowly crack under the pressure of the now foot high surge that surrounded them. Dakota! he heard his brother yell as he sat up so fast his neck hurt.What the fuck, Dakota kept repeating to himself. Are you okay? Benny asked.Yeah I just died in your game and had my life flash before my eyes. None of the good parts either, Dakota answered.I'm sorry. I've heard that happens the first time you load up one of these types of programs. Obviously we don't know any who can afford to legitimately, Benny trailed off.What's wrong? Dakota asked?You hacked into a piece of technology that is literally installed in your brain, Benny answered, I just worry that something will go wrong. No hack has ever been flawless.What do you want me to do? It's not like I can just unhack my NET, Dakota responded.I'm just glad you're okay. It seems to be working fine, Benny responded,Your game is dope, Dakota exclaimed before continuing, Sorry I freaked out… that was a super surreal experience coming out of there. I hope you're right and that's a one-time thing. Also who is Pat? He felt so real.Oh Pat is sort of real. It's a sidekick made for you procedurally based on the neural map your NET has created. He is not always a man and will almost always have a different name. Benny responded.Holy shit! I've never seen AI that advance. You made Pat? Dakota asked.I slightly modified an open source program. You've interacted with AI way more advanced than that. You just knew you were interacting with something manmade those times, Benny answered.Fuck. I guess, Dakota responded.How do you think I could increase player agency? Benny asked his brother.I'm not sure, Dakota answered.There's nothing you wanted to do but couldn't? Benny asked.I didn't want to do anything. I wasn't really me. I feel like the person I experienced being did everything they wanted to, Dakota answered.Well I'm not sure how NET filters out your memories and controls the way you experience things. Genesis Tools is just for world building and character creation but I can't really do anything directly to the player character, Benny answered.I have an idea but it's kind of weird, Dakota stated.What is it? Benny asked humoring his brother. What if the player could find little notes around the world telling them about what to expect next in the world you created. Things only someone who has already played through it before could know. You could allow the player to discover they are in a simulation while they are separated from their memories because of the simulation, Dakota answered.That's actually brilliant, Benny stated.Yeah. I mean it's not really my idea I tried DMT in NET when I hacked it with the person who installed the hack and it made me think a lot about whether NET is a simulation within a simulation because it can be as convincing as our reality.What is DMT? Benny asked.It's a powder that I had mixed with some herbs and when you smoke it you travel to another dimension and become part of a complex interconnected universe populated by beings creating a decentralized omniscience through telepathy and empathy, Dakota answered.That was very eloquent, Benny said with a laugh.I was thinking about how to describe the experience a lot after I had it. I can't believe that was last night. It feels like a few life times ago.Time has been passing slow for me since that shit with dad too, Benny concurred.Yeah I mean hopefully our idea works and you can get a job and sell this program so we can get him a NET, Dakota stated.Well I guess I'll get on it, Benny agreed before returning to his laptop while Dakota went back to testing his brother's program. Chapter 10: A Deep and Distant DreamTime outside NET seemed to crawl as Dakota sat around their living room waiting for Benny to finish the edits they'd talked about the night before. As he sat he felt the base of his neck vibrate before a message displayed in the air in front of him: URGENT – 26 days of life support remaining on John Sellers' state care plan. Fuck! Dakota shouted causing his brother to run into the living room. What's wrong, Benny asked.I guess Dad has less than a month left on life support, Dakota answered. Yeah. He never had a job. He's just got a state care plan, Benny said. Well fuck. I didn't know. Should we get a lawyer and try and press charges against those fucking weekend warriors? Dakota asked.We can't afford a license for even the cheapest legal consultation software. Why do you think I've been spending all my time in Genesis Tools? Benny asked clearly annoyed.You always work this hard, Dakota answered.Maybe it just seems that way to you because you spend most of your time incapacitated. I can't believe you don't even understand how healthcare works, Benny retorted, I need to get this fucking job.I get it. I've always been the fuck up and the dumbass, Dakota responded before lying back on the couch and falling into his mind.It was a sunny day in Dakota's New Orlando while Benny's was dark and dank as always. Benny shouted at his brother but Dakota decided he may as well take advantage of his new tools and disabled external audio input to avoid any further disruptions. He sent Sophia a quick message to let her know he was online but got no response or indication she would appear like last time. He loitered around the familiar streets for a bit before deciding to leave the only world he had ever known. Dakota remembered how his dad would reminisce fondly on his days in Denver. Dakota had never seen a mountain or snow and thought himself into the Rockies with the new control he'd gained over NET. After thinking about the spots his dad had described and showed them pictures of Dakota found himself at the top of a sunlit glacier with light so blinding he had to think himself some sunglasses in order to see the beauty he'd imagined. Dakota wandered amongst the mountains with an ease reality would never be able to offer. Dakota found a frozen waterfall amongst the mountains he liked that overlooked the sunset and thought his self into that part of the day. He looked out from atop the waterfall at the sun setting behind mountains untarnished by the concrete monoliths he was used to. As he sat there Dakota thought about the stories his dad would tell them about camping out in the woods with his friends. Dakota and Benny never had the luxury of making friends. The storms made traversing the city impossible sometimes and unbearable the rest of the time. Dakota checked his messages again before deciding that Sophia likely was not going to be joining him tonight. He thought about what to do by himself in nature and decided that walking around staring at unnatural natural beauty was not going to cut it and he decided to supplement this external beauty with a heavy dose of some internal beauty. Dakota willed a bong filled with the DMT blend he'd smoked last time into existence and decided to blast off. He took the first hit and held it in as long as he could which was as long as he wanted here and exhaled after 20 seconds hearing a now even more familiar buzzing begin in his chest. As he took the second breath he began to hear the frequency his body was experiencing and the bong he was using began to look more and more like an extra-dimensional stained glass artifact. Dakota took a final deep breath before setting down the bong and lying back on the ice atop the waterfall he had ascended. He closed his eyes and ceased to be Dakota anymore, he wasn't Dak either, he was everything. He understood family in a way he never had before as fractals of mechanical looking elves danced before him he knew that he was always a part of this space and always had been. Space is the wrong word Dakota thought to himself feeling strangely lucid for the dream he was living. He wanted to tell the entities surrounding him where he had been all this time but realized that they already knew. As he lay in his mind in his mind two of the entities approached Dakota with a familiarity and autonomy that seemed to contradict the oneness Dakota felt, although he did not realize this irony in the moment he experienced it. They grabbed his being and began to show him other worlds filled with a tribal technology that blended the organic with the futuristic. Dakota understood the way everything was supposed to come together and knew that the opposite was occurring outside his body outside his body. He forgot this revelation and most of the remnants of enlightenment that he had transposed into a form that could be understood by his memory in its default neurochemical state. He just knew one thing, this world isn't real, and he woke up back in his living room and knew one thing, this world isn't real. Dakota rose back into himself and stood up looking at the now clean leaving room surprised to find that at least half a day had passed. He walked into his room to see if Benny was there and was surprised to find his room empty. Dakota had not intended to stay in NET that long and decided to enjoy a night alone. After his experiences in NET Dakota wanted to really try DMT. He went onto Final Bay and ordered half a gram of changa as well as a cheap corncob pipe to smoke it out of and waited for a drone to arrive at their window for delivery. Dakota was relieved the skies were clear enough he didn't have to wait downstairs for a car. He'd been avoiding the stairwell since the incident a few days prior. After a brief wait the drone arrived with the changa that Dakota had ordered and he loaded up his new pipe sat on the couch, lit it up, and inhaled hard and long. After about ten seconds Dakota began to cough violently before mustering the strength for hit number two which remained in his lungs even shorter. He managed to hold the third and final hit for half a minute and as he began that final draw he began to hear and feel the familiar frequency. He lay back on the couch awkwardly dropping the pipe and felt himself rise abruptly as he closed his eyes. He felt weirdly like he was peeing himself and patted his crotch just be sure and was surprised when it returned to him dry. Dakota felt the familiar sensation of blasting off without moving and after a few moments in the familiar fractal tunnel he once again found himself home. Chapter 11: ???Benny once again found himself in the all too familiar waiting room of one of New Orlando's public hospitals. Trinity Shepard Hospital was a remnant of the 20th century and the pervasive smell of mildew was a constant reminder of the building's history. Benny thought back to the last time he was here. Things looked different then the mad dash of nurses, doctors, and patients had given way to a now calm nearly empty waiting room. People always talk about the calm before the storm but not the calm after, which Benny found to be eerier.  This time he was here to see his father's body rather than his mother's and waited for one of the orderlies to take him to see it. He had to refer to his dad as his father's body. He hoped that his mother did not understand the conversations they had over her body last time they were here. Benny? a nurse asked.Yes, Benny answered.Come with me.Benny followed the nurse in silence down the harsh halls still lit with fluorescent bulbs humming loudly. They walked past empty rooms and Benny wondered why the state could only afford to keep his dad alive a month before realizing they could definitely afford to keep him alive longer. They just chose not to. Benny didn't know who the they he was thinking about were exactly but understood that people in power were conspiring against him without even meaning to. He hoped the revisions to his program would allow him to one day become one of those people. Benny's time with Genesis Tools showed him that he could construct a better reality than the one he was stuck in, regardless of whether or not he got hired. They arrived at Benny's dad's room and the nurse left him there to interact with his father's body. Hey dad, Benny said before continuing, I'm sorry I haven't been over to visit in a few days. I'm pretty sure you can't hear me but I figured I might as well update you on things. I'm almost done with the program I've been working on. Hopefully I'll really be able to show it you soon.Benny's father's body lay still with wires and tubes entering him and the constant beeping and whirring of machinery seemed to indicate that he was stable. Benny sat in a chair beside his father and began putting the finishing touches on the experience he'd been working to create. He added in the notes and clues Dakota suggested he add throughout the world in ways that tied into the storyline he had originally been working on. Benny hoped their hunch was right and that player agency meant the ability to control and destroy whatever knowing there are no consequences. He submitted the program and this time stayed awake watching the spinning logo on his screen and hoped that his program would be good enough for Genesis Co. A few minutes later Benny was met with a screen he had never seen before, Congratulations your project has been chosen as a part of the Exodus program, please enter your citizen ID and await further instruction. Expect to be contacted in the next 24 hours. Fuck yes! Benny shouted as tears of joy streamed down his face. After his brief celebration benny looked at his father's motionless body and began to cry tears of sorrow. He had nobody to share his achievement with until he got home and Benny immediately resolved not to tell Dakota he'd gotten the job. He decided his brother deserved a little more time in the hot seat after his lack of personal responsibility earlier. Benny sat next to his father's body refreshing the inbox on his watch over and over until he fell asleep eagerly awaiting the message he hoped would free him.Chapter 12: Exodus Dakota went to sleep in his real bed in his real room awaiting his brother's return. It was unlike Benny to sneak out in the night but Dakota didn't put too much thought into it given that Benny no longer had anyone to sneak away from. Dakota didn't want authority over his brother and planned not to bring up their fight from earlier or Benny's absence the next time he saw him. Dakota figured discussing either would likely be a waste of time that would only lead to further arguments. Dakota drifted off into sleep easily, another benefit of NET. When Dakota awoke he found Benny on his laptop in their disheveled living room typing and glancing at the tablet next to him. He didn't notice Dakota enter the room until he took a seat next to him and saw apartment interiors littering the screen.I got the job, Benny said clearly distracted.Fuck yeah! That's awesome. Why aren't you more excited? Dakota asked.I'm excited. I'm just trying to figure out my travel arrangements quickly. I need to get my NET installed by one of their in house doctors because it'll be a special developer's model, Benny answered.That's dope! So you'll have hacks like me? Dakota asked.I mean I guess. Probably a little bit more just because I'm sure there are tools the average end user wouldn't be able to safely use. Benny replied.Are you still pissed at me? Dakota asked.No, Benny answered flatly.Where were you last night? Dakota asked.I was with Dad, Benny answered.How was that? Dakota asked.A lot like visiting mom, Benny answered.I'll head over there tomorrow, Dakota responded half to himself. Benny went back to his work with intent that let Dakota know their brief conversation was over. Dakota felt something was off about Benny but couldn't quite place his finger on it. He tried to remember how long it had been since their dad had drowned and if this was Benny's first or second visit but failed to recollect anything. Dakota couldn't tell if his brother was mad at him, the situation, or just scared of the for once promising future he'd now secured. Dakota decided to go back to his bedroom and into NET. He could not understand why Benny wasn't more excited and was jealous that Benny could receive the type of opportunity Dakota had always hoped would fall into his lap without even seeming to care. Dakota had dreamt of leaving New Orlando since as far back as he could remember. Every other place in the world seemed to be filled with adventure and opportunity except for the one place Dakota happened to grow up. As Dakota lay in bed and felt himself sink into another version of himself he smiled. Dakota found himself back in the mountains he had heard so much about as a child and decided to head to another part of the country his dad had always had a romantic fascination with, New York City. A thought later and Dakota was in Times Square, not the Time's Square he'd seen on the news growing up, but the times square he saw in old movies his dad loved when he was growing up. Dakota couldn't bring himself to visit his Dad's body and opted instead to visit a part of his dad's life. Dakota found himself overwhelmed by the abundance of people and decided to turn down the population density on the simulation he was running and watched as 70% of the crowd around vanished into thin air. Now he was able to move freely through the LED soaked streets. He did not understand why these streets were so special to his father and wished that he could be there and explain. Dakota sent another message to Sophia hoping she would appear behind him on the now vacant sidewalk but was not immediately met with the result he hoped for. Dakota continued to wander around the city aimlessly. He thought about all the funny stories his dad had about living in Brooklyn and set out to replicate one of those nights. Dakota spawned himself into a cluttered basement filled with various types of alternative people ranging from body modded opiate addicts, nude psychedelically influenced performance artists, suited Wall Street types with chronic cases of coke nose and some aesthetic quirk that made them appear somewhat sketchy, and some festival wooks that flaunted their imagined poly-substance addictions with neon backpacks filled with a little of everything. Dakota walked around the party he'd created watching performance art, screamo bands, and other events he'd hear about take place. Dakota's night was nothing like those described by his father. He had a fun time playing god but didn't need the drugs most people take to feel like one. Having everything go exactly as he'd imagined was the last thing he'd imagined. Dakota knew every good story starts with a fuck up. His dad had told him this countless times but no matter how hard he'd tried Dakota couldn't replicate a fun night out. He thought back to Benny's game and craved another play through. Dakota wanted to feel truly alive as a human not as disembodied consciousness experiencing the fractal architecture of the universe. After a night of playing god Dakota did not feel like playing the enlightenment game and abstained against imagining himself DMT or some other new drug to try. Instead Dakota decided to load up Benny's game and experience what felt like real risk and real adventure. Chapter 13: New Game +Dakota felt himself sinking and began to plummet into the crime filled world of Benny's New Orlando. As he sunk Dakota began to forget about Benny and himself until Dak rose from a bed in a disheveled New Orlando apartment to the familiar call, Please enter the nearest emergency shelter for your safety, the loudspeaker echoed ad nauseum to the citizens of New Orlando. Please ensure your own safety before ensuring the safety of others. Pets and personal artifacts will not be permitted within any public emergency shelter without the proper documentation. Please provide proof of citizenship upon arrival at any public emergency shelter for admittance. Dak felt a strange sense of dj vu as he arose from bed to the familiar siren.                                   Chapter ? Start of Second Act      Rain clattered against a metal rooftop overhang in a dimly lit alley behind one of New Orlando's poorly funded rehab clinics Fresh Horizons. Smoke rose up around the doorway from the sheltered addicts beneath. They'd always joke that they ran out of positive adjectives and nouns to combine when naming this clinic. Dakota was new to the joke and politely laughed when the woman he'd gifted a cigarette to first made it. Dakota was nervous about his first court ordered session at group and hoped that he wouldn't have to explain how he'd got there. He'd always felt alone but without his family and the friends that used to live in his head he truly was alone. He took one last drag of his cigarette before giving a half nod to the recipient of his earlier gift. Then Dakota drew in a breath and entered the horrifically lit room and took a seat around the central square table hoping it wasn't somebody else's normal spot. A moment later a man entered and sat next to him.Looks like you took my spot, the mystery man said coyly before taking off his hood and jacket and settling into the seat left of Dakota. His eyes had the unmistakable flicker of someone removed from reality.Sorry, Benny responded.The man laughed before continuing, As addicts we're all creatures of habit. I appreciate the help. Any subversion is a service.Dakota felt at ease around the man and allowed himself to be more forward than normal. So you must've been selling pretty seriously… Benny started before the man interrupted.Yeah I know it's impossible to hide. I managed to get the full NET package back before cleaning cash was so hard. What tipped you off my eyes?Yeah, Dakota responded quickly realizing his curtness and blushing.No need to feel bad about being honest, the man responded noticing Dakota's change in color, I promise I don't record or anything like that. That would be illegal here. Oh I wasn't even worried about that, Dakota trailed off as the man next to him rose. It was time for meeting to start and Dakota realized that he had been talking to his chapter's leader.       First off I would like to thank all of you for coming back this week. Everyone go on give yourself a round of applause, the man commanded gently. Everyone clapped besides Dakota who remembered a week ago he was in a coma. And can we get a round of applause for our new member? Please introduce yourself, the man asked.Hey everyone… um I'm Dakota and I'm an addict.Hi Dakota, the room echoed while their mysterious leader palmed his face.Oh shit I totally forgot. Hello everyone as all of you besides Dakota know I'm Sean and I'm a recovering addict. I've got a little over three years under my belt, a little over two fully clean without nicotine, caffeine, or any of their legal alternatives. I'm here to get to listen to you and to let you listen to me and that's it. Dakota felt calmed by Sean's presence and rhetoric. He was less commanding than the counselors that had interrogated Dakota about his drug use as his brain scrambled to drip out some dopamine to make coherent responses possible. For the first time Dakota felt optimistic about his recovery. Alright so now that we're done with introductions I would like to begin with a quick prayer before we begin talking about our step for today, step four, Sean continued as the other members began to speak in unison, God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Dakota watched everyone else complete a chant he had yet to memorize and felt isolated but hopeful. He did not know what step four was yet but Sean had him captivated and ready to learn. Okay, so I know most of you know what step four is but would anyone like to explain to our newcomer Dakota? Sean asked the group.The woman Dakota had gifted a cig to earlier stood up and introduced herself, Hi my name is Amanda and I'm an addict. It's nice to meet you Dakota, she said and Dakota nodded in acknowledgement as she continued, I've been sober three months now and step four is a fearless moral inventory. Working through all the steps is important and to reach this step you have to have accepted the unmanageability of your addiction and the truth that only a higher power however you understand it is equipped to help you manage.Dakota again felt isolated. He'd never believed in religion or spirituality just chaos. He thought about voicing this but figured everyone in the room had heard his same objections a million times before. He only had twelve weeks of mandatory meetings and resolved himself to just ride it out.As Dakota contemplated Amanda's explanation Sean began speaking again, Thank you Amanda. That was a great explanation however I'd like to briefly expand on what the stepbook we use means when it refers to a higher power that will help us manage our addiction. The text words a higher power as being anything even the group itself that will allow you to manage your addiction. It's like that experiment with the rats where they put a single rat with some water and some cocaine water and the rat does blow till it dies every time. But conduct that same experiment in a rat community and the rate of addiction drops near zero. A higher power can be god but ultimately it means community, which is one of the benefits believers in organized religion get from organizing in the first place. I know all of you have been here before and can confirm that finding your higher power doesn't happen overnight. What you perceive as more important than yourself will change. You just need to believe in something greater than yourself.Dakota nodded in agreement and felt at ease hearing this and quickly returned to his previously hopeful state knowing that he would be accepted and helped regardless of his beliefs and his past. As an addict he rarely got to be himself constantly code switching and lying by omission for work, time with family, and the other mundane parts of his existence. Dakota was not usually a sharer but decided that he would make an effort to let some part of his experience be known. After pausing to allow room for contemplation Sean continued, One of the first questions this step requires answering is whether or not you are disturbed by the word moral. Would anyone like to speak on this?There was a lull for minutes that felt like hours before Amanda stood again, So I know I just shared but this is my twelfth week here and I've theoretically worked through the steps and become rehabilitated but I still don't know how to reconcile this question with my actual beliefs. I just can't see how drug use is immoral according to what I perceive as the correct objective code of ethics.The room became uncomfortable. Fleeting glances were shared amongst the other members. Benny gave a sympathetic look to Amanda trying to communicate that he too felt her apprehensions, but he could not tell if this glance was recognized. Sean looked at her not with malice or admiration but with a contemplative look suggesting an effort to understand that made Dakota more comfortable as he waited to hear a response to what Amanda had said.Sean stood to respond, Amanda I totally understand where you're coming from and felt the same way. It took a while for me to recognize ideas I'd seen as propaganda were correct and it took hitting rock bottom for me to gain the perspective change required for my sobriety to succeed. Using drugs truly is wasteful. Our entire city of New Orlando is the result of hedonism and the prioritization of convenience and pleasure over sustaining landscapes and lives. Every dollar spent on getting high could be spent preparing for the next catastrophe in an effort to mitigate the suffering it causes. The time we spent high could have been spent learning how to contribute to solutions to these catastrophes as well as other social issues. Using drugs objectively has a human cost. They're waste and waste has a human cost, Sean eloquently concluded before sitting down. Amanda appeared increasingly annoyed through Sean's response and retorted, Obviously I've seen the propaganda you're talking about. It's literally impossible to avoid. I just can't help but feel entitled to how I alter my own experience of consciousness. I get I'm supposed to buy into everything in this book or find myself predestined for relapse but I just can't see it that way. I don't understand why I have to condemn drug use as immoral when I believe it is my right to do what I want with my mind and my body. Don't get me wrong I want to stay sober and I can recognize that I do more immoral shit when I'm using but I don't think the use itself is the immoral part.Sean smiled before responding, Let me first say I value having my philosophical outlooks challenged and appreciate what you have said Amanda. Sobriety would obviously be easier if you could condemn all your past actions related to use. I can't change your beliefs for you and it sounds like you regret enough of the decisions you've made to have a reason to continue with sobriety.After Sean's response the other members of group became at ease and no longer shared fleeting eye contact that ostracized Amanda. Dakota felt inclined to share his opinion and voice agreement with Amanda's statement but decided to wait and see where Sean steered their group's conversation. Dakota felt himself dissociate more and more as the meeting continued. Sean directed discussion from morality to a debate about whether or not institutions are to blame for addiction or the individual. As conversation became more democratized Dakota began to feel isolated again. He made fleeting eye contact with Amanda after comments he knew she too would disagree with but was unsure if she was meeting his eye or spacing out. Benny stared at his wrist counting the final 300 seconds until meeting was over in his head and looked up only when Dakota stood again to conclude meeting.Thank you everyone for being here today. Feel free to loiter in here or outside a bit after meeting. None of us our going to recover in isolation and you never know when reaching out to someone is going to save their life or yours.Dakota had quickly grown disenchanted with Sean's rhetoric and smirked at his melodramatic conclusion. He stood to begin walking outside after a few other members of group had already begun their cigarette exodus. As he approached the door he heard his name, Hey Dakota, and turned to see Sean beckoning him. Um hey Sean, what's up?I need your citizen ID number so I can say you were here and make sure you don't get slapped with a parole violation, Sean answered. Oh shit thanks. I figured that was automated, Dakota responded before giving his information to Sean.You know how it is with privacy laws, closed records, medical stuff, stuff like that, Sean responded.You don't think all that information is centralized and we just fill out forms so we get the illusion of privacy through decentralization? Dakota asked unusually pointedly and poignantly. Fuck if I know. I could tell you weren't vibing with the stepbook stuff we were talking about. You can be honest. Okay, here goes my honesty, Dakota began as he gesticulated sharply sweeping his hands with an unusual passion, None of the shit you were saying even applies to me. I was a NET addict. I hacked it. I spent all my time in there. Sure I did drugs while I was in there but it's not the same and you know it. If anything I saved resources by staying in my bed most of the time.Your NET use didn't negatively affect anyone else? Sean asked. I didn't it didn't, Dakota retorted nervously before apologizing, I'm sorry.It's okay Dakota, Sean responded before glancing at some other group members waiting for their turn to speak with him, You don't need to apologize for your honesty. Early recovery is a difficult time. It's when we're at our most volatile and I haven't taken what you've said personally. I look forward to seeing you next week and hope you find some time to work through the first step on your own. Thanks Sean. I'll see you next week, Dakota responded as he turned to exit the building hoping Amanda had not left yet. He briskly pushed back out into the soaking alleyway and found himself back under the overhang instinctively handing a cigarette in a bid to start conversation.Thanks, Amanda whispered as she reached for the cigarette and a lighter. So you've been coming here twelve weeks now? Dakota asked trying again to begin a conversation. Yeah. I got the standard sentence. A week a step, but I guess I'll keep coming here even though I don't really have to now, Amanda stated bluntly.Did coming here help you? Dakota asked sincerely. Eh, I mean it's been twelve weeks. Seems a bit early to tell. True. I'm glad you're going to keep coming not that that should mean anything to you, Dakota stammered before continuing, I mean we barely know each other but it's nice to not have to feel alone in my skepticism.Amanda laughed before responding, I hope I don't come off as so cold people feel the need to apologize for appreciating my presence.Dakota smiled, happy to have heard Amanda's laugh for the first time, before responding, Sorry. I've only been sober a couple weeks and you just get so fucking used to apologizing just for existing it sort of becomes habitual.Amanda laughed again in agreement before continuing, I've gotta get going but it was nice meeting you Benny. I know early sobriety is tough and the boredom and loneliness can be literally excruciating. If you want to hang out somewhere voluntarily I'd love to exchange info.It was nice meeting you too, Dakota responded cheerfully before reaching out a fist and receiving a bump from Amanda's. Their palms vibrated and Amanda turned to go. As Dakota watched her leave the door behind him opened and Sean along with the stragglers waiting to speak to him exited the building. Sean and the others stopped by the exit for a cig as well. You want one? Sean asked nodding to Dakota.I just had one with Amanda, Dakota responded.That's good. It's important not to be isolated in early recovery. It's also important to be independent while you recover. I don't want you to think I'm saying you and Amanda shouldn't be friends. I'm just saying friends tend to enable each other's bullshit because they want to make and allow each other to be happy. I hope I'm not overstepping, Sean concluded. It's cool, Dakota responded uneasily, I guess I hadn't thought about things that way. Having more than one perspective on recovery while you're in recovery is helpful. It's something that helped me. If you want to exchange information I'm here whenever, Sean stated before reaching out his fist to Dakota.       Thank you. I appreciate it, Dakota said hesitantly before their fists touched and buzzed. I'm going to head out but I'll see you next week, Dakota concluded before beginning his trudge through the rain. Sean waved goodbye before returning his attention to the other group members still waiting for his guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                         48
